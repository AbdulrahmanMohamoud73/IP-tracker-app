# IP Address tracker
![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg) 

# Description
This an IP Address Tracker app that I built using the design above using an [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) and [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) for the mapping functionality

# Decisions and Process

Design: Provided by [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/home)
Tech choices:
- Framework: React 
- CSS: Used TailwindCSS
- API library: used Axios

Decisions:
Problem: API key maybe exposed 
Solution: Using Environment Variables and Processing API calls on the Backend using Node with Express to follow best practices

# DEMO
